 |1-last_digit.py |Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
 |2-print_alphabet.py |Program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase (not followed by a new line).
 |3-print_alphabt.py |Prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase (not followed by a new line) except for the letters `q` and `e`.
 |4-print_hexa.py |Print all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
 |5-print_comb2.py |Print numbers from 0 to 99, separated by `,` followed by a `space`, numbers should be printed in ascending order with two digits.
