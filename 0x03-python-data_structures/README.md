## Description of each file:

 | Files          |Desription
 |:----------------|:-------------------------------:|
 |0-print_list_integer.py |Function that prints all integers of a list.
 |1-element_at.py |Function that retrieves an element from a list (like in C).
 |2-replace_in_list.py |Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
 |3-print_reversed_list_integer.py |Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
 |4-new_in_list.py |Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
 |5-no_c.py |Function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.
 |6-print_matrix_integer.py |Function that prints a matrix of integers.
 |7-add_tuple.py |Function that adds 2 `tuples`.
 |8-multiple_returns.py |Function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
 |9-max_integer.py |Function that finds the biggest integer of a list (you are not allowed to use the builtin `max()`).
 |10-divisible_by_2.py |Function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
 |11-delete_at.py |Function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
 |12-switch.py |Function that switch the value of `a` and `b` --> a source code was given and we could only modify one line.
